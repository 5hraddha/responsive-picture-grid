# responsive-picture-grid
## About the project
This webpage is a static but a responsive grid of pictures in a unique layout.

## Technologies and Standards Used
**The technologies that have been used are:**
1. HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) 

**The main concepts that have been emphasized are:**
1. [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)

The website is using [BEM — Block Element Modifier](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/) methodology to create reusable and understandable components in CSS. The idea behind it is to divide the user interface into independent blocks. This makes interface development easy and fast and it allows reuse of existing code without copying and pasting. We are also using [Nested BEM File structure organization](https://en.bem.info/methodology/filestructure/#nested) for CSS.
